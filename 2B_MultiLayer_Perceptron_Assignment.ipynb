    "### Multi-Layer Perceptrons\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple logistic regression example we went over in the previous notebook is essentially a one-layer neural network, projecting straight from the input to the output predictions.\n",
    "While this can be effective for linearly separable data, occasionally a little more complexity is necessary.\n",
    "Neural networks with additional layers are typically able to learn more complex functions, leading to better performance.\n",
    "These additional layers (called \"hidden\" layers) transform the input into one or more intermediate representations before making a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the logistic regression example, the way we performed the transformation was with a fully-connected layer, which consisted of a linear transform (matrix multiply plus a bias).\n",
    "A neural network consisting of multiple successive fully-connected layers is commonly called a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). \n",
    "In the simple MLP below, a 4-d input is projected to a 5-d hidden representation, which is then projected to a single output that is used to make the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/MLP.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the assignment, you will be building a MLP for MNIST.\n",
    "Mechanically, this is done very similary to our logistic regression example, but instead of going straight to a 10-d vector representing our output predictions, we might first transform to a 500-d vector with a \"hidden\" layer, then to the output of dimension 10.\n",
    "Before you do so, however, there's one more important thing to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nonlinearities\n",
    "\n",
    "We typically include nonlinearities between layers of a neural network.\n",
    "There's a number of reasons to do so.\n",
    "For one, without anything nonlinear between them, successive linear transforms (fully connected layers) collapse into a single linear transform, which means the model isn't any more expressive than a single layer.\n",
    "On the other hand, intermediate nonlinearities prevent this collapse, allowing neural networks to approximate more complex functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of nonlinearities commonly used in neural networks, but one of the most popular is the [rectified linear unit (ReLU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "x = \\max(0,x)\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to implement this in PyTorch.\n",
    "We could do it with elementary PyTorch operations:"

    "- Be careful using `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss()`. \n",
